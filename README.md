# Auto File Organizer üìÇ

A Python script that programmatically organizes files in a specified directory based on detected keyword patterns in filenames. It uses regular expressions to parse filenames, identifies recurring substrings, and moves files into categorized folders accordingly.

## ‚ú® Features

- Parses filenames using regular expressions to detect recurring keywords
- Aggregates keyword frequency and dynamically creates folder structures
- Moves files into corresponding directories based on matched patterns
- Supports multiple file formats (.pdf, .txt, .docx, etc.)
- Built for macOS with easily configurable cross-platform compatibility

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/auto-file-organizer.git
   cd auto-file-organizer
   ```

2. Rename the main script to `tidyup` and make it executable:

   ```
   mv tidyup.py tidyup
   chmod +x tidyup
   ```

3. Add a shebang to the top of the file if it's not already there:

   ```
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   ```

4. Run the script from the terminal:

   ```
   ./tidyup
   ```

5. What happens under the hood:
   - The script scans the target directory and retrieves all filenames.
   - It uses regular expressions to tokenize filenames into substrings.
   - It counts the frequency of each token across all files.
   - High-frequency keywords are used as labels for folder creation.
   - Files are moved into the appropriate folder(s) based on matched keywords.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Implement real-time **auto-sorting** when new files are added
- Add **GUI support** for drag-and-drop file organization
- Extend compatibility for **Windows & Linux**
