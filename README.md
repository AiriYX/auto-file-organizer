# Auto File Organizer 📂

A Python-powered tool that **automatically organizes files** based on common patterns in filenames. It scans a directory, detects keywords that appear frequently, and sorts files into categorized folders.

## ✨ Features

✅ Scans filenames to identify repeating keywords  
✅ Groups files into structured folders automatically  
✅ Supports different file formats (.pdf, .txt, .docx, etc.)  
✅ Works seamlessly on macOS (can be extended to other OS)

## 📌 How It Works

1. The program **extracts keywords from filenames** using regex.
2. It **counts keyword occurrences** and detects common patterns.
3. Files with similar patterns are **automatically moved** into matching folders.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement real-time **auto-sorting** when new files are added
- Add **GUI support** for drag-and-drop file organization
- Extend compatibility for **Windows & Linux**
