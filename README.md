# Auto File Organizer ðŸ“‚

A Python-powered tool that **automatically organizes files** based on common patterns in filenames. It scans a directory, detects keywords that appear frequently, and sorts files into categorized folders.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Scans filenames to identify repeating keywords  
âœ… Groups files into structured folders automatically  
âœ… Supports different file formats (.pdf, .txt, .docx, etc.)  
âœ… Works seamlessly on macOS (can be extended to other OS)

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. The program **extracts keywords from filenames** using regex.
2. It **counts keyword occurrences** and detects common patterns.
3. Files with similar patterns are **automatically moved** into matching folders.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- Implement real-time **auto-sorting** when new files are added
- Add **GUI support** for drag-and-drop file organization
- Extend compatibility for **Windows & Linux**
